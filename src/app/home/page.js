        Introduction about me!

Outdoorsman. Bourbon Enthusiast. Single Dad.
Growing up at the coast is where I began loving the outdoors. I love everything
from days at the beach to camping, hiking, and kayaking in the mountains. Some
of the best times Iâ€™ve had have been sitting around an outdoor fire with friends
sharing laughs and drinks. Also, I like the adventure of taking a road trip to a new
place and see what I can discover! I keep myself in shape and eat healthy
although I feel indulgence in dessert is a necessity for joy in life.
